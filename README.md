# DPER vol 5 book chapter R scripts

R code and associated files for my chapters in the book [Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments, Volume 5: Data Handling and Numerical Techniques](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2745-8). I authored, or co-authored, three chapters in the book and each used R to some degree for the worked examples. As no R code was included in the book, this repo contains the updated scripts needed to reproduce the examples in my chapters.

The three chapters are

 * Statictical Learning in Palaeolimnology
 * Analogue Methods in Palaeolimnology
 * Human Impacts: Applications of Numerical Methods to Evaluate Surface-Water Acidification and Eutrophication

Annotated versions are available on my blog, but those versions are not guaranteed to be current; always refer to the scripts in this repo for the most up-to-date versions.  Annotated versions are

 * [Statictical Learning in Palaeolimnology]({{ site.url }}/code/dper-scripts/chapter-9-statistical-learning.html)
 * [Analogue Methods in Palaeolimnology]({{ site.url }}/code/dper-scripts/chapter-15-analogue-methods.html)
 * [Human Impacts: Applications of Numerical Methods to Evaluate Surface-Water Acidification and Eutrophication]({{ site.url }}/code/dper-scripts/chapter-19-human-impacts.html)
